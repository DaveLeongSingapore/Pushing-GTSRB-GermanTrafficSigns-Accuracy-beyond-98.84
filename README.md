## DeepLearning-ComputerVision-GermanTrafficSigns
### Pushing German Traffic Signs Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) beyond human performance level(98.84%)
#### Background: This repo builds on Udacity project 2 and attempts to republicate end to end machine learning without manually designing extensive features extraction functions increasing efficiency 
#### Goal 1: To learn and build deep learning model(e.g. Inception, VGG, Resnet) to improve GTSRB's performance
#### Goal 2: Improve visualisation above and beyond Udacity project 2(widgets) leveraging Bokeh
