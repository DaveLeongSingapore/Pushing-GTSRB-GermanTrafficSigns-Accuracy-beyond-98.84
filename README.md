## DeepLearning-ComputerVision-GermanTrafficSigns
### Pushing German Traffic Signs Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) beyond human performance level(98.84%)
#### Background: This repo builds on Udacity project 2 and attempts to republicate end to end machine learning without manually designing extensive features extraction features increasing efficiency 
#### The motivation of using Deep Learning for GTSRB to improve accuracy is in (Traffic Sign Classification Using Deep Inception Based Convolution Network) Mrinal Haloi's paper which includes more than 6 convnet
#### Goal 1: To learn and build deep learning model(e.g. Inception, VGG, Resnet) to improve GTSRB's performance
#### Goal 2: Improve interactive visualisation above and beyond Udacity project 2(widgets) leveraging Bokeh
#### Goal 3: Provide a machine learning platform to integrate reinforcement learning into supervised learning network
